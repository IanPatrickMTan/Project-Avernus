The name is inspired by an Exurb1a book but I believe that the idea that everything has conciousness is idiotic. Certain things get "conciousness" the trick to becoming "concious" is not fooling others into thinking its talking to something concious as Turing would have you believe, the criteria is instead to be able to fool yourself into thinking you're concious. This project is in no way something as grandiose and pretentious as to claim to create a concious being, instead this is simply a neural network I'm working on, I just thought the name would be a neat reference.
